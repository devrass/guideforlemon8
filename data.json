As Lemon8 prepares for its official launch in May, it is likely that more prominent names in the social media industry will join the app, creating a need for user verification. The most significant difference between Lemon8 and Instagram is that Lemon8 is a new and fresh platform for social media users, unlike Instagram which has been around since 2010. While TikTok created a new generation of social media celebrities, perhaps Lemon8 will do the same. Are you planning to create a Lemon8 profile? Let us know in the comments below.",
